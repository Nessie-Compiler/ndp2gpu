# ndp2gpu

Early work on compiling Nesl to GPUs.

The NDP2GPU project has moved to the following location:
`git@github.com:Nessie-Compiler/neslgpu.git`

It may be retrieved using the following SVN command:
``` bash
  git clone git@github.com:Nessie-Compiler/neslgpu.git
```

The other directories in this repository are part of an unrelated project to
generate GPU code from a nested data-parallel language.
